title: Introduction to this blog

<p>This is yet another blog but the focus of this is functional programming or at least my understanding of it.</p>
<p>As a C# developer by day, it will come as no surprise that my functional language of choice is F#.</p>
<p>Hopefully the information on here is useful to someone else other than myself.</p>
