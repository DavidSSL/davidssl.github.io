Here is a list of links to resources which I believe will help you learn F#. It is in order of increasing
difficulty.

### Beginner
- [Get Programming with F#](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp?query=get%20programming%20with%20f). This is a great getting started book on F# explained in a clear and understandable manner. It will challenge you and although some concepts will stump you, simply look at the book's forum as it's likely that others would have encountered the same problems. I have read it twice and also use it as a reference.
- [F# Jumpstart](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fsharp-jumpstart/table-of-contents). This is a bit of a repetition of the basics as explained in the "Get Programming with F#" but there are also a few nuggets of information.
- [F# Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fsharp-fundamentals/table-of-contents). This one is optional but again also contains a few nuggets of information and it provides an running thread example.

### Novice
- [F# Functional Data Structures](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fsharp-functional-data-structures/table-of-contents). This will improve your understanding and usage of the various data structures available in F#. It also provides a good explanation of the various Higher Order Functions available with these data structures and this will help you write more declarative coce.
- [Accessing Data with F# Type Providers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/accessing-data-fsharp-type-providers/table-of-contents). This is a very good course on using the various Type Providers which is one of the great features in F#. Type providers allows you to access data in a low ceremony way.
- [Stylish F#](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484239995). A very good book which helps you write more idiomatic code to solve the various challenges on your functional journey.
- [Domain Modeling made functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional). This is yet another great book which does exactly what it says on the in. This is written by Scott Wlaschin, who you will undoubtedly come across while learning F#.

### Intermediate
- [The Functional Programmer's Toolkit - Scott Wlaschin ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrp_LZ-XGsY). In functional programming there are what are known as map and bind functions and you can initially become quite confused about which one to use and when. This video explains what is happening and will help you understand some functional terms such as Monads, Monoids, Applicative functor.
- [Asynchronous programming in F# 1/ 3 - Why and How ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2SlQ5WdL2k&list=PL-nSd-yeckKhsHa6Hr90oYjfFHGiRbPF4). This is the first part in a 3 part series about using the Async keyword in F#. It will make you appreciate the previous video even more.

## Various resources

This part contains various resources which I've come across and which I have found useful.

### Videos
[F# for C# programmers - Scott Wlaschin](https://vimeo.com/223982162). Great introduction on F# and does exactly what it says on the tin
[The Power of Composition - Scott Wlaschin](https://vimeo.com/254635723). This shows you how F# helps with composition.

### Youtubers
[The DevOwl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOX5DkLyqctM-wkOAU_mUpA). Good and informative series about F#.

### Blogs
[F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/). This is the reference par excellence for F# development. It contains depth and breadth.
[F# Friday](https://bradcollins.com/tag/f-friday/). This is often where I end up when I need to refresh my memory on Higher Order Functions.
